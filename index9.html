Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we’ve been through
That I’ll be standing right here
Talking to you about another path I
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn’t last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
hard work forever pays
now I see you in a better place
<br>
<br>
<br>
How could we not talk about family when family’s all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
<br>
It’s been a long day without you my friend
And I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again
We’ve come a long way from where we began
Oh I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again
when I see you again
<br>
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and what’s
Small turn to a friendship
a friendship turn into a bond
and that bond will never be broke
and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
and that line is what we reach
so remember me when I’m gone
<br>
How could we not talk about family when family’s all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
<br>
So let the light guide your way
hold every memory as you go
and every road you take
will always lead you home
<br>
It’s been a long day without you my friend
And I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again
We’ve come a long way from where we began
Oh I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again</p></p></ul></font>
